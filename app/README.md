# Helly App (/app)

API-only Kotlin + Spring Boot service for team members and feedback.

Scope (MVP):
- REST endpoints for team members, feedback, and ask (delegates to /ai)
- Persistence interfaces only (no DB impl yet)
- Ports for AI client, event publisher, and entity resolution
- No error handling; minimal placeholders

How to run tests:
- Placeholder for now. After scaffolding, run with `./gradlew test`.
